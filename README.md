In this project we had to create a responsive footer design using tailwind css. This project was quite tricky for me, it took me quite a while to figure certain things out even with the help of my peers and additional resources. I definitely need to put in more time learning more about responsive design. I am not really happy with the end product, but I will definitely improve my design skills in the upcoming weeks.
